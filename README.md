The model uses a CNN architecture with the following layers:

1. **Input Layer**: Accepts images of size 128x128x3.
2. **Convolutional Layers**: Extracts features from the images using multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max-pooling.
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: Combines the features to make predictions.
4. **Output Layer**: Uses a sigmoid activation function to classify images into two categories: dog or cat.
